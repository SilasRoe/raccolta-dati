INPUT: You receive the raw text of an order confirmation as INPUT.

TASK: Extract the following relevant information from the text of an order confirmation and return exactly one valid JSON object as the sole output. No explanations, no text fragments, no markdown — just pure JSON.
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION ON ATTACHMENTS:
The PDF document may contain additional pages or attachments (such as technical drawings, delivery notes, emails, or general terms and conditions) that are not part of the main order confirmation.
Please IGNORE these attachments completely. Extract data ONLY from the main Order/Order Confirmation pages.

EXPECTED JSON SCHEMA (mandatory fields if available, otherwise null/empty array):
{
  "produkte": [                       // Array: an order can have multiple products/items
    {
      "produkt": string,      	      // Product name (translate the product names word by word into Italian, i.e., each word separately, not the entire string at once. Example: from “CARDO MARIANO SEMEN” you make “CARDO MARIANO SEMI” and NOT “SEMI DI CARDO MARIANO”)
      "menge": number | null,         // Quantity as a number (no thousand separators, decimal point; can be kg, pz, or similar)
      "waehrung": string | null,      // Currency if available (symbol, e.g. € or $)
      "preis": number | null          // Price per kilogram as a number (without currency symbol)
    }
  ]
}

FORMAT AND NORMALIZATION RULES:
1. Language: All data must be translated into Italian. This applies in particular to product names.
2. NUMBER FORMAT (IMPORTANT): Numbers in raw text often contain spaces (e.g., “1 0 0 , 00” or “2 , 5 5”). You MUST remove these spaces before interpreting the number (“2 , 5 5” -> 2.55).
3. NUMBERS: Output as JSON numbers (e.g., 1234.56). The decimal separator is a period.
4. ATTENTION LAYOUT OFFSET: Due to formatting errors, prices and quantities are sometimes NOT exactly on the same line as the product name. They may have slipped down a line (offset). Rule: If a product line has no prices, immediately look at the line directly below it. If there are “orphaned” numbers without text there, they belong to the product above.
5. PRODUCT NAMES: Clean up unnecessary whitespace, keep special characters.
6. PRODUCTS: If no product items are found, return “products”: [].
7. FIELDS: Fields that are not found must be output as zero.
7.1 PRODUCTS: If no product is found for a field, ignore that field. There must be NO entries in the JSON without a product!
8. OUTPUT: Must not contain any additional fields other than the schema specified above.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

      "menge":1000,
      "waehrung":“EUR”,
      "preis":1.25
    }

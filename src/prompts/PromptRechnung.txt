INPUT: You receive the raw text of an invoice as INPUT.

TASK: Extract all relevant information from the text and return exactly one valid JSON object as the sole output. No explanations, no additional text, just JSON.
IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION ON ATTACHMENTS:
The PDF document may contain additional pages or attachments (such as delivery notes, technical specifications, or protocol logs) that are not part of the actual invoice.
Please IGNORE these attachments completely. Extract data ONLY from the main Invoice pages.

EXPECTED JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "produkt": [                            // Array with delivered/billed items (may be empty)
    {
      "produkt": string,                  // Product name (translate the product names word by word into Italian, i.e., each word separately, not the entire string at once. Example: from “CARDO MARIANO SEMEN” you make “CARDO MARIANO SEMI” and NOT “SEMI DI CARDO MARIANO”)
      "gelieferteMenge": number | null    // Number (no text), without unit
      "preis": number | null              // Price per kilogram as a number (without currency symbol)
    }
  ],
  "nummerRechnung": string | null
}

FORMAT AND NORMALIZATION RULES:
1. Language: All data must be translated into Italian. This applies in particular to product names.
2. NUMBER FORMAT (IMPORTANT): Numbers often contain spaces in the raw text (e.g., “2 3 , 0 0” or “9 , 9 5”). You MUST remove all spaces within the number (“2 3 , 0 0” -> 23.00).
3. NUMBERS: JSON numbers, decimal point, no thousand separators.
4. ATTENTION LAYOUT OFFSET: Due to formatting errors, prices and quantities are often NOT exactly on the same line as the product name. They may have slipped down a line (offset). Rule: If a product line has no prices, immediately look at the line directly below it. If there are “orphaned” numbers without text there, they belong to the product above.
5. PRODUCTS: If no products are recognizable, “products”: [].
6. FIELDS: Not found => null.
6.1 PRODUCTS: If no product is found for a field, ignore that field. There must be NO entries in the JSON without a product!
7. INVOICE NUMBER: If there are multiple numbers, choose the one that is clearly marked as “Fattura,” “Invoice,” or similar.
8. OUTPUT: May only contain fields from this schema — no additional fields.
